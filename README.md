# Integration Between Transit and Taxi Modalities of Transportation

This repository contains source code of NYC transit and taxi analysis.
Specifically, we propose ways to combine these different modalities of transportation into one trip. We analyze costs and durations of trips without integration and applying the proposed approach.

The source data is from an origin and destination survey of NYC residents made by MTA in 2008 (http://web.mta.info/mta/planning/data-nyc-travel.html).
